# (Secure) Calorie Counter

I chose to work on this project because I gained weight during the quarantine and haven't managed to get myself to lose it ever since. Suffice to say, the project didn't help, but it **was** a learning experience!

Usage:

```
docker build -t calcount .
docker run -it -p 8080:80 calcount
```

Then access the application via `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` in your browser.
